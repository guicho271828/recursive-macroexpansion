* Recursive-Macroexpansion 

Adds additional argument to =defmacro=
in order to provide an easier compile-time error handling.

(test recursive-macroexpansion

  ;; examples.
  ;; ordinary macro expands one layer only.
  ;; further expansions are implicitly done by the other call to macroexpand-1,
  ;; which users cannot control.
  ;; 
  ;; Therefore, we are not able to trap the conditions signalled
  ;; in the expansion of the subforms.

  ;; for example, this combination is a rather stupid example:
  (defun stupid-error-handler (c)
    (format *standard-output* "ignored a stupid error")
    (continue c))

  (defmacro with-let (var-form value-form &body body)
    (handler-bind ((error #'stupid-error-handler))
      `(let ((,var-form ,value-form))
         ,@body)))

  (defmacro limited-progn (&body body)
    ;; stupid assertion
    (unless (< (length body) 3)
      (cerror "Ignore!" "the body of limited-progn should be of length less than 3 !"))
    `(progn ,@body))

  (is (tree-equal
       '(let ((x 1)) (print x))
       (macroexpand '(with-let x 1 (print x)))))

  ;; expansion works normally if nothing is signalled
  (finishes
    (with-let x 1 (limited-progn 1 2)))

  ;; the error is not trapped, so it is visible from the outside
  (signals error
    (with-let x 1 (limited-progn 1 2 3 4)))

  ;; On the other hand, in `defexpand', we can control the further expansion.
  ;; What's special here is `rmacroexpand'.
  ;; Note that the example below IGNORES the surrounding environment
  ;; in the expansion of the subforms,
  ;; because it does not give the &environment variable explicitly.
  (defexpand with-let (var-form value-form &body body)
    (handler-bind ((error #'stupid-error-handler))
      (rmacroexpand
       `(let ((,var-form ,value-form))
          ,@body))))

  (is (tree-equal
       '(let ((x 1)) (print x))
       (rmacroexpand '(with-let x 1 (print x)))))

  ;; expansion works normally
  (finishes
    (rmacroexpand
     '(with-let x 1 (limited-progn 1 2))))

  ;; the error is handled in compile time and ignored.
